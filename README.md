In this project, ViewCode was used to reduce the chances of “merge” conflicts in Git compared to Storyboard. The framework used to download images and cache storage was Kingfisher, as it left the project with a better performance. REST was used for API development because it has automatic caching, supports several API versions, uses different HTTP status codes to facilitate error identification, among other benefits.
